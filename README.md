#  Intro to Databases with SQL 

## What is DBMS
> A collection of data organized for creating, reading, updating, and deleting.
## Database Management System
> Software via which we can interact with a database.
### Database Management software
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

## SQL (Structured Query Language)
> A language via which you can create, read, update, and delete data in a database.


## SQL Clauses
> In SQL, a clause is a component of a SQL statement that performs a specific task. There are several main SQL clauses commonly used.

### Common SQL Clauses

```sql
Clause	Purpose
SELECT	Retrieve data from one or more tables
FROM	Specify the table(s) to query
WHERE	Filter rows based on conditions
ORDER BY	Sort the result set
GROUP BY	Group rows that share a value
HAVING	Filter groups (like WHERE but for grouped data)
LIMIT / TOP	Limit the number of rows returned (depends on SQL dialect)
JOIN	Combine rows from multiple tables
DISTINCT	Remove duplicate rows
INSERT INTO	Add new rows into a table
UPDATE	Modify existing rows
DELETE	Delete rows from a table
CREATE	Create tables or databases
ALTER	Modify table structure
DROP	Delete tables or databases

```



### SELECT
> The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database.
> SELECT * means choose all columns from a table
```sql
SELECT * FROM students; -- means all columns
SELECT name, age FROM students; -- get only name and age columns
```

### LIMIT
> It is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 

```sql
      SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
```

### WHERE
> It allows me not all rows but some rows base on conditions is true
```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18 LIMIT 3;
```


## Conditional Operators in SQL

Conditional operators are used in SQL to **filter, compare, and make decisions** in queries.  
They are mainly used in the `WHERE` clause or in expressions like `CASE`.

---

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=`      | Equal to | `WHERE age = 20` |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal to | `WHERE city <> 'Dhaka'` |
| `>`      | Greater than | `WHERE salary > 50000` |
| `<`      | Less than | `WHERE age < 30` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `WHERE age >= 18` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal | `WHERE age <= 25` |

```sql
-- Select students aged 18 or older
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18;

-- Select employees not in Dhaka
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE city <> 'Dhaka';

### Logical Operators

> Logical operators combine multiple conditions:

>Operator	Meaning	Example

-AND	Both conditions must be true	WHERE age >= 18 AND city = 'Dhaka'
-OR	At least one condition is true	WHERE city = 'Dhaka' OR city = 'Rajshahi'
-NOT	Negates a condition	WHERE NOT city = 'Chittagong'

```sql
-- Students who are adults AND live in Dhaka
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18 AND city = 'Dhaka';

-- Employees living in either Dhaka or Rajshahi
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE city = 'Dhaka' OR city = 'Rajshahi';

```


### Special Operators
> Operator	Purpose	Example
- BETWEEN ... AND ...	Select values within a range	WHERE   age   BETWEEN 18 AND 25
- IN	Match a set of values	WHERE city IN ('Dhaka', 'Rajshahi')
- IS NULL	Check for empty value	WHERE email IS NULL


```sql
-- Students aged 18 to 25
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 25;

-- Students living in specific cities
SELECT * FROM students WHERE city IN ('Dhaka', 'Rajshahi');

-- Students with missing email
SELECT * FROM students WHERE email IS NULL;
```


#### SQL LIKE Operator

- LIKE is used in a WHERE clause to match patterns in string data.

> There are two special wildcards:
- `%	- Zero or more characters	'A%' matches Amin, Ali`
- `_	- Exactly one character	'A_i_' matches Amin, Avid`

```sql
-- Names starting with A
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Names containing "mi" anywhere
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%mi%';

-- Names with 4 letters, starting with A
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A___';

-- Names starting with A, 4 or more letters, third letter is 'i'
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A_i%';

```

### Conditional Expression (CASE)

> The CASE statement works like IF-ELSE in SQL to return values based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT name, age,
  CASE 
    WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Minor'
    WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
  END AS category
FROM students;
```


## SQL ORDER BY Clause

> ORDER BY is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns.

- Default sorting is ascending (ASC).

- You can also sort descending (DESC).

<p>Sort by one column (descending)</p>

```sql
SELECT name, age, city
FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;

```

<p>Sort by multiple columns</p>

```sql
-- Sort students by city first, then by age within each city
SELECT name, age, city
FROM students
ORDER BY city ASC, age DESC
LIMIT 5;

```


## SQL Aggregate Functions

> Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They are often used with GROUP BY, but can also be used alone.

<p> Common SQL Aggregate Functions </p>

<p> 1. COUNT() – Counts the number of rows. </p>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;
```

<p> 2. SUM() – Adds up numeric values. </p>

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;
```

<p> 3. AVG() – Calculates the average of numeric values. </p>

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM students;
```

<p> 4. MIN() – Finds the minimum value. </p>

```sql
SELECT MIN(age) AS youngest_student
FROM students;
```

<p> 5. MAX() – Finds the maximum value. </p>

```sql
SELECT MAX(age) AS oldest_student
FROM students;
```

<p> Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY </p>

If you want summaries per category, you can combine aggregates with GROUP BY.

Example:

```sql
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS total_students, AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM students
GROUP BY class;
```

> Result: For each class, you get the number of students and the average age.

> Important Notes

Aggregate functions ignore NULLs (except COUNT(*)).

You can use HAVING to filter after aggregation:

```sql
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

`HAVING is like WHERE but works after aggregation.`


## SQL DISTINCT Clause

> The DISTINCT clause is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a SELECT query.

> It ensures that only unique values appear in the output.

Example: Without vs With DISTINCT

```sql
-- Without DISTINCT
SELECT city FROM students;

-- With DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM students;
```
